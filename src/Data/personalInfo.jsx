I am a Full-Stack Web Developer from Philippines, I am recently graduated in TUITT Boothcamp Phillippines specialize in PHP / Laravel and become the top performer of the class. But before I enroll in Tuitt, coding is already in my blood and passion. I was a graduate of Computer System Design and Programming, a 2 years laderize course offered at AMA Computer Learning Center back in 2009-2011. Because of my outstanding performance, I was awarded a certificate "Programmer of the Year". I was also the passer of TESDA Object-Oriented Programming Competency Certification NCIV in 2011. I used to be a windows application programmer and web designer in private sector before I shift to Material/Asset Management and later on, in HR Industry. In my spare time, I practice my coding skills, I also love playing games like chess and playing guitar. For me, coding is life and learning is limitless. I am now pursuing the 2nd chance of my career in IT Industry. In this page, you can find CONTACT section to reach me.
